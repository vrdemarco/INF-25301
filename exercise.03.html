    Hi, my name is Vincent DeMarco. I am learning how to code in HTML and this page is part of my class assignment.

      <figcaption>This is just small caption for the figure, which is a smiling emoji!.</figcaption>
    </figure>

      This is just the beginning of my journey with HTML. Soon I will be learning how to style my pages with CSS 
      and eventually add interactivity with JavaScript. With this page, I wanted to work on hierarchy and struture.
